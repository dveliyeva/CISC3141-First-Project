# CISC3141_FirstProject

Name: OATEE
For the first semester project I will be creating a new product launch page about oat milk. 
Oat milk is a more environmentally friendly alternative to dairy, non-dairy, and plant-based milk options available in the market today.

The goal of this project is to show that oat milk is a just-as-tasty addition to their diet with out the extra water consumption needed to produce it.
